In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been conducting data analytics research with the aim to forecast/predict the evolution of the pandemic. At this point in time, we are publishing our one-day ahead forecasting of confirmed cases and death cases for each county in Texas and each State in the United States. More specifically, we publish our forecasting for the next day and contrast our forecasting to the next-day data when it is published by [NYTimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=85609380&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Es1TD-LA9n2POTrLqt7EPJjUu0FWX-lXafIObmG2HGv_QrQD3Fkj_Ho4zMvCxAV2Jm5QJUoqdbmnXbY0ZXw8-r35H_Q&_hsmi=85609380). Our time series forecasting models are trained from the NYTimes dataset.

For example, we use the historic data of the number of confirmed cases up to April 29 to train a model to forecast that by April 30 there will be 1,356 confirmed cases in Bexar county, Texas. On May 1, NYTimes publishes that there were 1,374 confirmed cases by April 30, which means that our one-day-ahead forecasting is only 18 confirmed cases less than the actually-observed number of confirmed cases (or a 1.31% prediction error).

We plan to publish our multiple-day ahead forecasting soon.

If you have any questions, please email to the POC.
